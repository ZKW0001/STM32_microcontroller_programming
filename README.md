## STM32_Microcontroller_Programming

# Project overview
This project involves developing an embedded system application on an STM32 microcontroller, integrating peripherals such as a joystick, RGB LEDs, an LCD, potentiometers, and a speaker. The system is implemented as a state machine to handle various functionalities, including **clock management with the ability to set and display the current time**, **a world clock supporting multiple time zones**, **a stopwatch**, and **a countdown timer**.

User interaction is facilitated through joystick buttons with interrupts and potentiometers for setting values and navigating options, while visual and audio feedback is provided via LEDs and the speaker.

# Example output
- Clock management with the ability to set and display the current time

- World clock supporting multiple time zones

- Stopwatch

- Countdown timer
